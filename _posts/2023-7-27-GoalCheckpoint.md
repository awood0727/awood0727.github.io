So far with p5.js I’ve done two commits. I fixed some typos I found in documents and was able to open two issues and close them both with my pull requests to the main repository.I’ve been added to the contributor list too as a document contributor.

Since we’ve been working with p5.js I learned a lot about how to successfully and accurately document an Issue. I’ve been providing a lot of screenshots to make it easier for my issues to be understood. I also include appropriate screenshots in my pull request to showcase the changes. 

Within the next two weeks I really want to be able to make a code contribution. I would like to learn more about p5.js and how to understand the javascript they used to build their library. 


When reflecting on my previous post and the goals I set there, I definitely have improved my writing capabilities. I work really well to document information, changes, and issues I’ve encountered.
I also have been doing very well to help others troubleshoot issues they’ve encountered. 

To keep building on this progress I think I can just keep moving forward and working on more complicated issues.
As we go further into contributing I think the problems will only get harder, so building and utilizing my comprehension skills.
This will better help me understand what I’m interacting with and with that I’ll get better at documenting and explaining to others

Emily has really been a great support person so far. I think to move forward, just having her there to answer questions or if she’s new to something too, point us in the right direction will greatly help.
