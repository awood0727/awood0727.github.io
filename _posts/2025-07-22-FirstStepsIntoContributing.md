title: First Steps into Contributing
---

Hello, it has been a while since I last posted here, and that is because I chose to create a would-be blog post into a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350393072825884672/) post instead.
However, in the past week, [@npNSU](https://github.com/npNSU), [@kaybcodes](https://github.com/kaybcodes), and I have dipped our toes into becoming first-time contributors to projects outside of the Contributor 
Catalyst group! Our small team has looked into the processing repository, and after searching through many good first issues, we came across one issue that may have 
more than just one issue. So the issue is that on macOS, there is a coordinating issue dealing with color. However, we have found that not only is it true that 
there is a coordinating issue with color, but also with the position, because on a Windows operating system, the two polynomials are also positioned at two different points. No response has been given yet, but our next move may have to require us to move away from good first issues and look into more 
difficult issues as there are not too many first issues left to report on the issue board.
