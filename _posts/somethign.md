Tooltips were different colors, and maintainers are looking to become more compliant with WCAG standards. Research and possible solutions were made; however, we determined that there is much more that needs to be done, and we can only complete a small portion of what we believe needs to be done. | Waiting on maintainers to look through our comment |
