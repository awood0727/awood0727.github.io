title: The Greying of Open Source
---

Recently, I watched a video discussing how Gen Z will help maintain the future of open source. From my experience working under the Processing umbrella, I’ve 
noticed that many of the maintainers are constantly working behind the scenes and engaging with the public. For example, there have been a lot of comments on a 
particular bug issue I’ve been focusing on, but due to the maintainers sorting out logistics on their end, they haven’t really been available to help newer 
contributors right now.

I also want to touch on Abby’s perspective. She believes it’s time for open source to become more inclusive of Gen Z. She argues that it's time to TikTokify and 
gamify open source. In my opinion, if this is done correctly, it could really pay off. Personally, I don't like short one-minute videos. I 
would rather read, especially when it’s something important.

As for gamifying open source, I’ve experienced something like that before and I enjoyed it. But it’s also worth noting that some people might just play 
the game for fun without actually learning anything from it. Overall, though, I like Abby’s approach to incentivizing more people to become maintainers in 
open source by finding ways to monetize the work and give people a stronger sense of fulfillment.
