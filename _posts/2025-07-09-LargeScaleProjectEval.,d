title: Large Scale Project Evaluation
---

The purpose of the p5.js open-source repository is to create a free and
 open JavaScript library for creative coding. As of the time of writing this, 
678 contributors are working on the p5.js project, and I think it is necessary 
to note that there are also about 24,400 users associated with the project in 
sometype of way or form. Additionally, there were 779 commits in the past
 year, and 71 of those commits were made in the last 30 days. This repository
 is also very active, as there were 15 contributors who were credited for making
 those 71 commits in the last 30 days, as well as multiple new issues being
 added to their GitHub issue tracker within the last week, and many pull requests
 are reviewed as soon as they are made. If I were to be interested in helping this
 project, I would follow the same steps I would in the smaller-scale project.
 Find an issue that I would like to handle, do my research, and see what is the
 best way to fix it, then proceed with commenting my intent on the issue, wait
 for the maintainers or leaders to give me approval, and proceed to work on it. 

P5.js has a lot of documentation you can follow. First, their readme file leads
 to their own page that has a lot of information on how you can get started, tutorials,
 and even a link to their Discord. Focusing back on their readme, however,
 they have notes on how to notify other contributors of issues and how to get
 started as a new contributor. As stated before, bugs and issues are tracked
 in GitHubâ€™s issue tracker. There are many issues that are open, and mainly,
 a lot of people are showing their intent to work on the issue, along with their
 plan of how they are going to implement their change. I believe it would not
 take too long to download the p5.js repository, mainly because all you would
 need is Visual Studio Code, which I already have, and they even allow the use
 of their own web editor. Mainly, developers communicate with each other through
 Discord, and one thing to note if you do have any concerns about an error 
with p5.js, you will have a response fairly quickly. One interesting thing I learned
 is that p5.js is very active, and the response times are fast.

Compared to the smaller-scale open source security foundation scorecard, p5.js 
is way more active and has enough people to be able to produce more quickly. This
 project also pushes inclusivity a lot, which I feel makes it easier for new contributors
 to come in and work on issues. If I had to decide if I wanted to work on the
 smaller-scale scorecard or the larger-scale p5.js, I would work on p5.js, with
 the main reason being that there are more people involved to help me achieve
 my goal if I enter the project looking to contribute.
