title: Final Reflection for the Contributor Catalyst Program
---

Greetings, as of the time writing this, it is August 6th, 2025, and there are only two more days left of my stint working with the University of California, 
Santa Cruz Contributor Catalyst Program. This blog post is a reflection of my time with the program. To begin, I would like to look back at the goal I have set 
for myself, which was communication. I have never been great at communicating my thoughts and explaining exactly how I envision navigating through issues.
However, in the past two weeks, I feel like I have made the most progress I have ever made in the amount of time to get used to adjusting to a new setting 
and increasing my communication skills. I would like to think my group mentor [@SilasVM](https://github.com/SilasVM) and the coordinator of the program 
[@emmet0r](https://github.com/emmet0r) for being patient, being open to help when I got lost, allowing the time to communicate my thoughts,
and giving me a chance to make decisions for my team. I also think that needing to communicate with maintainers about issues and potential solutions also helped in
improving my communication. I needed to be clear and concise with what exactly I was commenting on. For example, when we needed to research an issue, I would
go into depth about what I found, and I documented everything that I believed was necessary to know, so everyone in my group knew where the problem was and what 
could be done to fix the problem. In the future, I believe it would be best to continue making progress in communication with the growth I have made in the 
Contributor Catalyst program.

Below are all the issues I worked on with my team, which includes: [@npNSU](https://github.com/npNSU), [@kaybcodes](https://github.com/kaybcodes), and [@SilasVM](https://github.com/SilasVM) within the Processing umbrella.
| Repository | Issue Number | Brief Summary | Results (as of 8/6/2025) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Processing4 | [981](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/981) | Maintainers wanted to move to a different build system, which was from Ant to Gradle. An earlier contributor worked on their request, but it was not liked. We researched and created a way to ease their transition to Gradle. | Accepted by maintainer, awaiting merge |
| Processing4 | [1131](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/1131) | Color of shape changes based on the version a user chooses. Learned that the issue was merged with a different issue, and someone is assigned | Assigned to a different contributor |
| p5.js | [6660](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6660) | Development environments show an error. We noticed it was a redundant else/if statement. | Approved by maintainer, given a merge date. |
| Processing4 | [1190](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/1190) | Processing's terminal would loop a statement if a user created a breakpoint in debug mode while the sketch and folder name were mismatched. Our team noticed that there was code for one file, but not the file in question. We created code to include that file. | Pull Request created, awaiting review from maintainers |
| p5.js Web Editor | [3527](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/issues/3527) | Issue with the word wrap setting, where the setting would turn on, but would not reflect in p5.js web editor. Progress was made towards, however, the issue was assigned to another individual. | Assigned to another contributor before more research could be done |
| p5.js Web Editor | [3079](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/issues/3079) & [3514](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/pull/3514) | Mainly accessibility issues. Tooltips were different colors, and maintainers are looking to become more compliant with WCAG standards. Research and possible solutions were made; however, we determined that there is much more that needs to be done, and we can only complete a small portion of what we believe needs to be done. | Waiting on maintainers to look through our comment |

In my opinion, I believe the most challenging issues we face are the issues we're working on now, 3079 and 3514. This is due to the amount of work our team 
calculated would need to be done; however, our time is limited, so if we were to claim the issue entirely, it would probably take more than two weeks to complete.
Additionally, with classes beginning soon, I fear we may focus more on our classwork rather than on the issue, which is why I hope p5.js allows us to only 
complete a portion of what we have outlined for them. On the contrary, I believe issue 1190 from processing4 was the most rewarding issue because. I had multiple 
problems setting up my dev environment for processing, which included downloading the wrong version of a dev environment, downloading a version of Java from 
the wrong vendor, and my laptop running out of space in the process. However, throughout all the troubles, I was finally able to completely run the dev
environment and solve an issue shortly afterwards.

Overall, I think the most valuable thing I have learned from this program is to trust yourself. In my opinion, when you are trying to contribute to open source,
it feels like you're shooting an arrow in the dark. You don't know where it's going to land, but you just hope it gets close or, if you're lucky enough, hits the 
target. If you don't hit the target, that's okay because you also have an unlimited amount of arrows, and the only thing that's going to stop you from contributing is  
yourself. I also feel like I have acquired the experience needed to continue to contribute to open source because once I learned how to use git all I need to do
now is the research necessary to learn the issues of any project. For the near future, at least, I do not see myself staying as engaged as I did while in the program
and that's because I want to stay focused on school. However, if I find myself with a lot a free time, I may come back and look into more issues.
If the opportunity were to present itself, I would be interested in coming back as a mentor, and I like the program as it is now, and I am interested to see 
how the program will expand in the future.

Closing out, I would like to thank [Dr. Lovell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilymarielovell/), my mentors [Silas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silas-morgan-87086420b/) and [Samir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vertexshader/),
Dr. Humphries and everyone involved with the Contributor Catalyst program. This is an experience I will always remember, so I wanted to thank you all 
for making this experience possible, and I will bring what I have learned everywhere I will go.
