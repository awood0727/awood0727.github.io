title: Small Scale Project Evaluation
---

The purpose of the Open Source Security Foundation Scorecard
 project is to help users improve their security practices and to help 
open-source consumers judge whether their dependencies are safe.
 There are 170 contributors working on the Open Source Security
 Foundation, and the project is not very active, as there have only been 
15 commits in the past month, as well as 251 commits in the past year. 
Additionally, there were only four contributors who worked on the past 
15 commits. If I were interested in helping with the open-source security
 foundation project, I would start by looking in the issues section to see 
what potential issues I would like to look deeper into to fix. After enough 
research, I would comment on my intent on the issues I have selected to
 fix and wait for the approval of an owner or maintainer. Once I have received 
approval, this is when I would say I have started to help with the project. 
There are many documents in the open source security foundation 
scorecard that describe the project. Primarily, in the readme section, 
there is a lot of information that explains what the scorecard is, how to use 
the scorecard, and the types of checks for the scorecard. In addition, 
there is a frequently asked questions link you can go to, along with the 
Open Source Security Foundationâ€™s Slack, where you can communicate 
with members of the community and ask questions. To note, there is also
 documentation on how to download the scorecard, but you will need to 
download GoLang, then you have to use Docker to install the program onto
 your laptop. There are a total of 1181 bugs and features that are recognized
 by their GitHub bug tracker, and 355 of them are open. Some of the bug
 trackers are being discussed; however, there is not much commitment to
 any of the open issues. I assume it goes back to the fact that not too many
 people are actively working on this. Based on its size, I believe it would take
 about a couple of hours to get everything downloaded and installed onto 
our computers because, looking through the readme documentation again,
 there is not a lot of support for Windows-based computers. As stated
 before, a lot of developers use Slack to communicate with each other. 
There are also channels available for you so you can join meetings and
 talk about the existing problems in the channel. For me, the most interesting
 thing I learned about this exercise is that even though a community may
 be small and inactive, there are still many opportunities for you to work 
on a project.
