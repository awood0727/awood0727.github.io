One challenge I would work on is helping connect more people to the internet. According to Forbes.com, about 66% of the world is now
connected to the internet. So it is about time to introduce everyone to the internet and finally unite the world digitally.
In addition, this also means I want to help make the transition easier for new people on the internet to help them understand exactly 
how it works, and pretty shows that the possibilities they are allowed to do on the internet are nearly limitless. When I am successful, I will tell my parents. They always want me to do the best I can and are always proud of me.

One open-source project related to this is Apache, and it displays the core functionality of web content. I feel if I were
able to create a page that explains something like how emails work, and create smaller tabs that explain what how
to create emails, how to send more than just messages through emails, etc. I can make the transition easier to new people on the internet.
