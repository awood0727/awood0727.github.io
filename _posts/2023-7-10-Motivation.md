Greetings evveryone, my name is Amante' Woodley and I am from Suffolk, Virginia. At the time of writing this, I am a rising junior 
at Norfolk State University majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.nsu.edu/dnimas/cs-cybersecurity) and foucsing on Cybersecurity. For the summer, I am working with 
the Contributor Catalyst Program and University of California at Santa Cruz and it has been very enjoyable. This is my 
first time in Califronia and the only thing that has really taken me for a surprise is the mountainous terrain 
and the drastic shift in temperatures coming from the 90s of coastal Virgina to the 70s of Santa Cruz.

Focusing back on the topic today which is open source experience I have to say that I do not have any prior open source experiences.
However, I am very excited to experience everything new that comes with open source coding and taking on any challenge that comes with it.

One of the strongest skill I believe that I can bring to the Contributor Catalyst team is problem solving. A lot of times 
I like to recreate the problem I was dealing with earlier so I can explain to myself and hopefully others as easily as possible when it
appears again.

One skill I would like to improve on is more communication. I normally like to work alone and only help when others ask me 
but I would like to adapt to being more proactive and communicating what I'm doing or what I'm planning to do with any 
project I'm tasked to work on.
