title: Checking In on my Goals
---

To recall my first blog post, I wanted to make progress on my communication skills. I believe that there is much more work to be done with my communication.
Although I have made progress, I still feel that I can improve even further. So, for the remainder of the program, I think I want to improve my 
communication skills by asking more questions and asking for more help if needed. I feel the best way my mentors can help is if they give as much advice as 
they can.
